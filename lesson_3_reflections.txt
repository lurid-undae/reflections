When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The main reason for using a remote repository is the ability it provides by syncing data in multiple locations.
Two examples why this is useful would be if someone else was working on and making changes to a project or if you
were wanting to work on a project from a another location away from you local machine.
