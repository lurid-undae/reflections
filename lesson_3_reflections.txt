When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  The reason for using remote repositories is for it's ability to sync data in multiple locations.
  Two examples for why this is useful would be if someone else was working on and making changes to 
  your project or if you were wanting to work on your project from a different machine or locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your
remote repository?

You need to be in control of the code you work on. There is no benefit working with buggy code that would
be unpredictable and always changing according to Git.

Describle the difference between, forks, clones and branches? When would you use one instead of the other?

  A fork is a clone of a repository that's only moved to a new location on GitHub. You'd use it when 
  you want ot make changes to the repository but you don't have permission to access the original. 
  Clones are copies of GitHup repositories that can be stored to anywhere you have access to Git. 
  You would use clones when you want to collaborate with people. Branches are changes made within the same 
  repository, generally used to fix bugs or introducing new features.
